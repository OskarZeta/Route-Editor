A simple application, that allows user to create a route through several waypoints. You can add waypoints with a special textbox by typing in a name for your waypoint and pressing "enter". Your waypoint will be created in center of the map (it's marked with a crosshair). You can select one of 4 different route modes (by automobile, by mass transit, by bicycle or on foot) nad also turn on/off the crosshair in settings menu (top right corner of the screen).

This application was created as a test task for FunBox company (https://funbox.ru).
